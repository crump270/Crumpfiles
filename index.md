Good Morning, good evening, or good afternoon. Thankyou for stopping by and seeing what I have cooking up in the Crump Files. My name is Ronald Crumpton also known as Crump. Raised in Radcliff,  I've done a lot in my young life, lived the college life, enjoyed my basketball career, went through the rigors of the military; and I loved every chapter that I went through. Enjoy the Show!!
